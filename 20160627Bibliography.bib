	Annote = {The Drosophila Y chromosome is a degenerated, heterochromatic chromosome with few functional genes. Despite this, natural variation on the Y chromosome in D. melanogaster has substantial trans-acting effects on the regulation of X-linked and autosomal genes. It is not clear, however, whether these genes simply represent a random subset of the genome or whether specific functional properties are associated with susceptibility to regulation by Y-linked variation. Here, we present a meta-analysis of four previously published microarray studies of Y-linked regulatory variation (YRV) in D. melanogaster. We show that YRV genes are far from a random subset of the genome: They are more likely to be in repressive chromatin contexts, be expressed tissue specifically, and vary in expression within and between species than non-YRV genes. Furthermore, YRV genes are more likely to be associated with the nuclear lamina than non-YRV genes and are generally more likely to be close to each other in the nucleus (although not along chromosomes). Taken together, these results suggest that variation on the Y chromosome plays a role in modifying how the genome is distributed across chromatin compartments, either via changes in the distribution of DNA-binding proteins or via changes in the spatial arrangement of the genome in the nucleus.},

Epigenetic regulation of transcription of the rRNA results in only a subset of copies being transcribed, making rDNA an important model for understanding epigenetic chromatin modification. We have created an allelic series of deletions within the rDNA array of the Drosophila Y chromosome that affect nucleolus size and morphology, but do not limit steady-state rRNA concentrations. These rDNA deletions result in reduced heterochromatin-induced gene silencing elsewhere in the genome, and the extent of the rDNA deletion correlates with the loss of silencing. Consistent with this, chromosomes isolated from strains mutated in genes required for proper heterochromatin formation have very small rDNA arrays, reinforcing the connection between heterochromatin and the rDNA. In wild-type cells, which undergo spontaneous natural rDNA loss, we observed the same correlation between loss of rDNA and loss of heterochromatin-induced silencing, showing that the volatility of rDNA arrays may epigenetically influence gene expression through normal development and differentiation. We propose that the rDNA contributes to a balance between heterochromatin and euchromatin in the nucleus, and alterations in rDNA—induced or natural—affect this balance.},

	Annote = {The Drosophila Y chromosome is a degenerated, heterochromatic chromosome with few functional genes. Nonetheless, natural variation on the Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster has substantial trans-acting effects on the regulation of X-linked and autosomal genes. However, the contribution of Y chromosome divergence to gene expression divergence between species is unknown. In this study, we constructed a series of Y chromosome introgression lines, in which Y chromosomes from either Drosophila sechellia or Drosophila simulans are introgressed into a common D. simulans genetic background. Using these lines, we compared genome-wide gene expression and male reproductive phenotypes between heterospecific and conspecific Y chromosomes. We find significant differences in expression for 122 genes, or 2.84{\%} of all genes analyzed. Genes down-regulated in males with heterospecific Y chromosomes are significantly biased toward testis-specific expression patterns. These same lines show reduced fecundity and sperm competitive ability. Taken together, these results imply a significant role for Y/X and Y/autosome interactions in maintaining proper expression of male-specific genes, either directly or via indirect effects on male reproductive tissue development or function.},

	Annote = {The D1 protein is a high mobility group A (HMGA)-like nonhistone chromosomal protein with primary localization to certain AT-rich satellite DNA sequences within heterochromatin. The binding of D1 to euchromatic sequences is less studied and the functional significance of its chromosomal associations is unclear. By taking advantage of existing P-insertion alleles of the D1 gene, I generated D1 null mutations to investigate the phenotypic effect of loss of the D1 gene. In contrast to a previous report, I determined that the D1 gene is not essential for viability of Drosophila melanogaster, and moreover, that loss of D1 has no obvious phenotypic effects. My tests for an effect of D1 mutations on PEV revealed that it is not a suppressor of variegation, as concluded by other investigators. In fact, the consequence of loss of D1 on one of six variegating rearrangements tested, T(2;3)Sb(V), was dominant enhancement of PEV, suggesting a role for the protein in euchromatic chromatin structure and/or transcription. A study of D1 protein sequence conservation highlighted features shared with mammalian HMGA proteins, which function as architectural transcription factors.},

	Abstract = {The nonrecombining Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome is heterochromatic and has few genes. Despite these limitations, there remains ample opportunity for natural selection to act on the genes that are vital for male fertility and on Y factors that modulate gene expression elsewhere in the genome. Y chromosomes of many organisms have low levels of nucleotide variability, but a formal survey of D. melanogaster Y chromosome variation had yet to be performed. Here we surveyed Y-linked variation in six populations of D. melanogaster spread across the globe. We find surprisingly low levels of variability in African relative to Cosmopolitan (i.e., non-African) populations. While the low levels of Cosmopolitan Y chromosome polymorphism can be explained by the demographic histories of these populations, the staggeringly low polymorphism of African Y chromosomes cannot be explained by demographic history. An explanation that is entirely consistent with the data is that the Y chromosomes of Zimbabwe and Uganda populations have experienced recent selective sweeps. Interestingly, the Zimbabwe and Uganda Y chromosomes differ: in Zimbabwe, a European Y chromosome appears to have swept through the population.},
