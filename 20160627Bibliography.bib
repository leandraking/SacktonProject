	Annote = {The methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5-meC) is an important epigenetic DNA modification in many bacteria, plants, and mammals, but its relevance for important model organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, is still equivocal. By reporting the presence of 5-meC in a broad variety of wild, laboratory, and industrial yeasts, a recent study also challenged the dogma about the absence of DNA methylation in yeast species. We would like to bring to attention that the protocol used for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry involved hydrolysis of the DNA preparations. As this process separates cytosine and 5-meC from the sugar phosphate backbone, this method is unable to distinguish DNA- from RNA-derived 5-meC. We employed an alternative LC--MS/MS protocol where by targeting 5-methyldeoxycytidine moieties after enzymatic digestion, only 5-meC specifically derived from DNA is quantified. This technique unambiguously identified cytosine DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana (14.0% of cytosines methylated), Mus musculus (7.6%), and Escherichia coli (2.3%). Despite achieving a detection limit at 250 attomoles (corresponding to <0.00002 methylated cytosines per nonmethylated cytosine), we could not confirm any cytosine DNA methylation in laboratory and industrial strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces boulardii, Saccharomyces paradoxus, or Pichia pastoris. The protocol however unequivocally confirmed DNA methylation in adult Drosophila melanogaster at a value (0.034%) that is up to 2 orders of magnitude below the detection limit of bisulphite sequencing. Thus, 5-meC is a rare DNA modification in drosophila but absent in yeast.},

These alterations are due to the derepression of the X chromosome-linked Stellate sequences. To understand how the derepression of the Stellate elements gives rise to these abnormalities, we have expressed the protein encoded by the Stellate sequences in bacteria and produced an antibody against the fusion protein. Immunostaining of crystal- testes has clearly shown that the Stellate protein is a major component of the crystals. Moreover, in vitro experiments have shown that this protein can interact with the catalytic alpha subunit of casein kinase 2 enzyme, altering its activity. IMAGES:},

	Annote = {The ribosomal rDNA gene array is an epigenetically-regulated repeated gene locus. While rDNA copy number varies widely between and within species, the functional consequences of subtle copy number polymorphisms have been largely unknown. Deletions in the Drosophila Y-linked rDNA modifies heterochromatin-induced position effect variegation (PEV), but it has been unknown if the euchromatic component of the genome is affected by rDNA copy number. Polymorphisms of naturally occurring Y chromosomes affect both euchromatin and heterochromatin, although the elements responsible for these effects are unknown. Here we show that copy number of the Y-linked rDNA array is a source of genome-wide variation in gene expression. Induced deletions in the rDNA affect the expression of hundreds to thousands of euchromatic genes throughout the genome of males and females. Although the affected genes are not physically clustered, we observed functional enrichments for genes whose protein products are located in the mitochondria and are involved in electron transport. The affected genes significantly overlap with genes affected by natural polymorphisms on Y chromosomes, suggesting that polymorphic rDNA copy number is an important determinant of gene expression diversity in natural populations. Altogether, our results indicate that subtle changes to rDNA copy number between individuals may contribute to biologically relevant phenotypic variation.},

@article{Bemmel:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Specific interactions of the genome with the nuclear lamina (NL) are thought to assist chromosome folding inside the nucleus and to contribute to the regulation of gene expression. High-resolution mapping has recently identified hundreds of large, sharply defined lamina-associated domains (LADs) in the human genome, and suggested that the insulator protein CTCF may help to demarcate these domains. Here, we report the detailed structure of LADs in Drosophila cells, and investigate the putative roles of five insulator proteins in LAD organization. We found that the Drosophila genome is also organized in discrete LADs, which are about five times smaller than human LADs but contain on average a similar number of genes. Systematic comparison to new and published insulator binding maps shows that only SU(HW) binds preferentially at LAD borders and at specific positions inside LADs, while GAF, CTCF, BEAF-32 and DWG are mostly absent from these regions. By knockdown and overexpression studies we demonstrate that SU(HW) weakens genome - NL interactions through a local antagonistic effect, but we did not obtain evidence that it is essential for border formation. Our results provide insights into the evolution of LAD organization and identify SU(HW) as a fine-tuner of genome - NL interactions.},

By integrative analysis of genome-wide binding maps of 53 broadly selected chromatin components in Drosophila cells, we show that the genome is segmented into five principal chromatin types that are defined by unique, yet overlapping combinations of proteins, and form domains that can extend over >100 kb. We identify a repressive chromatin type that covers about half of the genome and lacks classic heterochromatin markers. Furthermore, transcriptionally active euchromatin consists of two types that differ in molecular organization and H3K36 methylation, and regulate distinct classes of genes. Finally, we provide evidence that the different chromatin types help to target DNA-binding factors to specific genomic regions. These results provide a global view of chromatin diversity and domain organization in a metazoan cell.},

The affected genes are more highly expressed in males, more meagerly expressed in females, and more highly divergent between species.

	Annote = {The mammalian HMGI/Y (HMGA) non-histone proteins participate in a wide variety of cellular processes including regulation of inducible gene transcription, integration of retroviruses into chromosomes and the induction of neoplastic transformation and promotion of metastatic progression of cancer cells. Recent advances have contributed greatly to our understanding of how the HMGI/Y proteins participate in the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological events. All members of the HMGI/Y family of `high mobility group'proteins are characterized by the presence of multiple copies of a conserved DNA-binding peptide motif called the `AT hook'that preferentially binds to the narrow minor groove of stretches of AT-rich sequence. The mammalian HMGI/Y proteins have little, if any, secondary structure in solution but assume distinct conformations when bound to substrates such as DNA or other proteins. Their intrinsic flexibility allows the HMGI/Y proteins to participate in specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that induce both structural changes in chromatin substrates and the formation of stereospecific complexes called `enhanceosomes'on the promoter/enhancer regions of genes whose transcription they regulate. The formation of such regulatory complexes is characterized by reciprocal inductions of conformational changes in both the HMGI/Y proteins themselves and in their interacting substrates. It may well be that the inherent flexibility of the HMGI/Y proteins, combined with their ability to undergo reversible disordered-to-ordered structural transitions, has been a significant factor in the evolutionary selection of these proteins for their functional role(s) in cells.},

	Annote = {We have analyzed the expression pattern of the D1 gene and the localization of its product, the AT hook-bearing nonhistone chromosomal protein D1, during Drosophila melanogaster development. D1 mRNAs and protein are maternally contributed, and the protein localizes to discrete foci on the chromosomes of early embryos. These foci correspond to 1.672- and 1.688-g/cm(3) AT-rich satellite repeats found in the centromeric heterochromatin of the X and Y chromosomes and on chromosomes 3 and 4. D1 mRNA levels subsequently decrease throughout later development, followed by the accumulation of the D1 protein in adult gonads, where two distributions of D1 can be correlated to different states of gene activity. We show that the EP473 mutation, a P-element insertion upstream of D1 coding sequences, affects the expression of the D1 gene and results in an embryonic homozygous lethal phenotype correlated with the depletion of D1 protein during embryogenesis. Remarkably, decreased levels of D1 mRNA and protein in heterozygous flies lead to the suppression of position-effect variegation (PEV) of the white gene in the white-mottled (w(m4h)) X-chromosome inversion. Our results identify D1 as a DNA-binding protein of known sequence specificity implicated in PEV. D1 is the primary factor that binds the centromeric 1.688-g/cm(3) satellite repeats which are likely involved in white-mottled variegation. We propose that the AT-hook D1 protein nucleates heterochromatin assembly by recruiting specialized transcriptional repressors and/or proteins involved in chromosome condensation.},

The euchromatin-heterochromatin association is responsible for the inactivation of these genes in some cell clones. In Drosophila melanogaster the Y chromosome, which is entirely heterochromatic, is known to suppress variegation of euchromatic genes. In the present work we have investigated the genetic nature of the variegation suppressing property of the D. melanogaster Y chromosome. We have determined the extent to which different cytologically characterized Y chromosome deficiencies and Y fragments suppress three V-type position effects: the Y-suppressed lethality, the white mottled and the brown dominant variegated phenotypes. We find that: (1) chromosomes which are cytologically different and yet retain similar amounts of heterochromatin are equally effective suppressors, and (2) suppression effect is positively related to the size of the Y chromosome deficiencies and fragments that we tested. It increases with increasing amounts of Y heterochromatin up to 60-80{\%} of the entire Y, after which the effect reaches a plateau. These findings suggest suppression is a function of the amount of Y heterochromatin present in the genome and is not attributable to any discrete Y region.},

Despite this, natural variation on the Y chromosome in D. melanogaster has substantial trans-acting effects on the regulation of X-linked and autosomal genes. It is not clear, however, whether these genes simply represent a random subset of the genome or whether specific functional properties are associated with susceptibility to regulation by Y-linked variation. Here, we present a meta-analysis of four previously published microarray studies of Y-linked regulatory variation (YRV) in D. melanogaster. We show that YRV genes are far from a random subset of the genome: They are more likely to be in repressive chromatin contexts, be expressed tissue specifically, and vary in expression within and between species than non-YRV genes. Furthermore, YRV genes are more likely to be associated with the nuclear lamina than non-YRV genes and are generally more likely to be close to each other in the nucleus (although not along chromosomes). Taken together, these results suggest that variation on the Y chromosome plays a role in modifying how the genome is distributed across chromatin compartments, either via changes in the distribution of DNA-binding proteins or via changes in the spatial arrangement of the genome in the nucleus.},

Nonetheless, natural variation on the Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster has substantial trans-acting effects on the regulation of X-linked and autosomal genes. However, the contribution of Y chromosome divergence to gene expression divergence between species is unknown. In this study, we constructed a series of Y chromosome introgression lines, in which Y chromosomes from either Drosophila sechellia or Drosophila simulans are introgressed into a common D. simulans genetic background. Using these lines, we compared genome-wide gene expression and male reproductive phenotypes between heterospecific and conspecific Y chromosomes. We find significant differences in expression for 122 genes, or 2.84{\%} of all genes analyzed. Genes down-regulated in males with heterospecific Y chromosomes are significantly biased toward testis-specific expression patterns. These same lines show reduced fecundity and sperm competitive ability. Taken together, these results imply a significant role for Y/X and Y/autosome interactions in maintaining proper expression of male-specific genes, either directly or via indirect effects on male reproductive tissue development or function.},

The binding of D1 to euchromatic sequences is less studied and the functional significance of its chromosomal associations is unclear. By taking advantage of existing P-insertion alleles of the D1 gene, I generated D1 null mutations to investigate the phenotypic effect of loss of the D1 gene. In contrast to a previous report, I determined that the D1 gene is not essential for viability of Drosophila melanogaster, and moreover, that loss of D1 has no obvious phenotypic effects. My tests for an effect of D1 mutations on PEV revealed that it is not a suppressor of variegation, as concluded by other investigators. In fact, the consequence of loss of D1 on one of six variegating rearrangements tested, T(2;3)Sb(V), was dominant enhancement of PEV, suggesting a role for the protein in euchromatic chromatin structure and/or transcription. A study of D1 protein sequence conservation highlighted features shared with mammalian HMGA proteins, which function as architectural transcription factors.},

	Abstract = {The nonrecombining Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome is heterochromatic and has few genes. Despite these limitations, there remains ample opportunity for natural selection to act on the genes that are vital for male fertility and on Y factors that modulate gene expression elsewhere in the genome. Y chromosomes of many organisms have low levels of nucleotide variability, but a formal survey of D. melanogaster Y chromosome variation had yet to be performed. Here we surveyed Y-linked variation in six populations of D. melanogaster spread across the globe. We find surprisingly low levels of variability in African relative to Cosmopolitan (i.e., non-African) populations. While the low levels of Cosmopolitan Y chromosome polymorphism can be explained by the demographic histories of these populations, the staggeringly low polymorphism of African Y chromosomes cannot be explained by demographic history. An explanation that is entirely consistent with the data is that the Y chromosomes of Zimbabwe and Uganda populations have experienced recent selective sweeps. Interestingly, the Zimbabwe and Uganda Y chromosomes differ: in Zimbabwe, a European Y chromosome appears to have swept through the population.},
